# DupliCat

A simple utility for finding duplicated files within a specified path.
It is intended to be a library but can also be used as a commandline tool,
it doesn't delete the duplicate files found but returns a list of junk files so that you can choose the ones to delete.

## Usage As A Library

- Import the [dupliCat](https://github.com/teddbug-S/dupliCat/blob/main/src/dupliCat/__init__.py) class and create an
  object by passing the following arguments,
    - `path`
      where the search will be made, defaults to current directory.
    - `recurse`
      boolean, set to true if you want it to recurse down to all files in the path including sub-dirs
      defaults to `False`

### Methods

- the `generate_secure_hash` method takes a file as first argument and generates a secure-hash for it.
  Hashing algorithm is blake2b, key is the size of the file, it returns the file with secure_hash attribute
  set. File must be of type `dupliFile`.

- `read_chunk` this method reads a default 400 bytes of data from file. It takes the file as first positional
  argument and size as second argument which defaults to 400. File must be of type `dupliFile`

- `human_size` this is a static method that converts bytes into human-readable format.

   ```doctest
     >>> human_size(nbytes=123456)
     >>> 120.56 KB
   ```

- `hash_chunk` static method, takes two positional arguments, `text: str` and `key: int`
  hashes text with key using `blake2b`.


- call the `search_duplicate` method to begin the üîç search, search results will be stored in
  the `duplicates` property of the class. This method is somewhat the main api of the class, it
  does everything for you, calling other methods instead of this might remove the functionality of
  using files from `size_index` as input for generating a hash index.


- the `search_duplicate` method used to initiate a search for duplicates.
  Does not take any additional arguments.
  Junk files set by this method contains all duplicates with one file left over for each.


- use the `analyse` method to analyse search result, this returns a named tuple of type `Analysis`.
  It contains
  the total number of duplicate files accessed through `analysis.total_file_num`, their total size on the disk
  accessed through `analysis.total_size` and the most occurred file, accessed through `analysis.most_occurrence`.


- the `generate_size_index` method is used to generate the size index from files.
  It sets the result or the generated size_index to `self.size_index`
  takes the parameter
    - `files`: files from which size index should be generated.


- the `generate_hash_index` method is used to generate the hash index from files in the size index.
  It sets the result or the generated_hash_index to `self.hash_index`
  takes the argument
    - `files`: files from which hash index should be generated.

### Properties

- `size_index`
  You can also access the size index using the property. it is a dictionary containing files
  grouped by their sizes.
- `hash_index`
  You can also access the hash index using this property. It is a dictionary containing files
  grouped by their secure hashes.
- `fetched_files`
  access all fetched files from the search path
- `path`
  where the search will be made, defaults to current directory.
- `recurse`
  boolean, set to true if you want it to recurse down to all files in the path including sub-dirs
  defaults to `False`
- `junk_files`
  a list containing all duplicate files leaving an original copy each. Meaning you can go ahead and delete all files in
  this list

## Updates - version 3.0.5

- fixed the total size value
- added `junk_files` property
- new method `set_secure_hash` for setting the secure hash of a file if provided else generates one for the file.
- updated `generate_secure_hash` to only generate and return a secure hash for the file
- `fetch_files` now implements a recursive use of `os.scandir` instead of `os.walk` for faster file fetching.
- increased overall speed.

## Usage From Commandline

You can now use dupliCat from the command line.

   ```cli
   $ dupliCat --help
   ```

the above command will help you to use it.
